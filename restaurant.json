October of 2014. Every month we develop seven new drinks; everything from a specialty cocktail to a shot and beer or seltzer. Each month, the drinks are designed with a different theme and are paired with a shirt design that you earn that month.\n\nTo complete the challenge and earn the shirt, you must purchase all seven drinks by the last day of the month. In the event you complete the challenge and we do not have any shirts remaining, please follow the instructions on the back side of the challenge card to request your shirt and we will follow up with pick up instructions\n\nIf you are not able to come in to the restaurant to complete the challenge we have created a way for you to still get the challenge shirt. If you head to madisonsocial.com/challenge, you can purchase your challenge shirt there.\n\nIf inquired about the monthly challenge for January 2025, politely respond that the challenge is not currently out yet, but to check back on the website in a couple of days for the update.\n\nEmployment/Server Information:\nDirect the caller politely to their website where they are able to continue their application process, and follow with a happy remark that they are considering a position at Madison Social.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nFamily-Friendly: Suitable for family dinners, accommodating both small and large groups.\nParking: Available in nearby parking garages and street parking.\nOutdoor Seating: Options available for outdoor dining.\nPrivate Events: Spaces available for booking private events and gatherings.",
